                        <p>The idea of creating a sustainable or ethical wardrobe from scratch is, without doubt, a daunting one. Not being able to wear the brands you are used to, limiting your choices in terms of trends, having to spend a little more than you would normally?</p>

                        <p>All of these concerns are of course valid, but it isn't as hard as you might think to get started on a sustainable wardrobe – and it's definitively worth it in the long run. The table below shows just how vast the  environmental impact that the fashion industry has. </p>

                                    <p>Cost Per Wear is a simple concept: the value of an item  is considered by how much you use it. Buying a dress for €100 and wearing it once, it has a cost per wear of €100. Wearing it again, each wear now costs €50, wearing it 10 times: €10, and so on. </p> 
                                    
                                    <p>Before giving into the latest trends consider the cost per wear you will get from the item, if it is really worth it or if it will gather dust in your wardrobe after one wear.</p>

                                    <p>Not only does shopping vintage lead you to having a unique one-of-a-kind wardorbe but it is also immense environmental benefits. These range from fewer carbon emmisions to saving water and reducing waste.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>A garment that is purchased through the secondhand market reduces the need to manufacture a new item and thus saves resources. Modern synthetic fibers like polyester require lots of energy and oil inputs to synthesize the fibers.</p>

                                    <p>According to <a href="http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/clothing-waste-prevention">WRAP</a>, the value of unused clothing in wardrobes is estimated at 30 billion. Americans toss out 25 billion pounds of clothing every year, with only 15 percent of that being donated or recycled. You can easily donate your unwanted clothes to a local charity shop or even to a friend or family member.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>About 5% of what is donated is truly recycled and turned into brand new threads that eventually become new garments. H&M and Levi’s are two large brands that are doing exactly that, and they’re even collecting used textiles in their stores to help facilitate the process.</p>

                                    <p>The average lifetime for a garment of clothing is estimated as ~2.2 years. According to WRAP, extending the active life of clothing by just nine months can significantly reduce its overall environmental impact.</p> 
                                    
                                    <p>Taking good care of the clothes we already have and  also repairing them when needed is easy and cost effective way to so. Don't have the time or skill to repair yourself? A local seamstress/tailor is not hard to come by and won't break the bank.</p>

                                <p>Generally speaking, better quality will come with a higher price tag, but an expensive does not guarantee quality. The quality of a garment is fundamentally the fabric and construction. Nice fabrics combined with excellent construction are a recipe for a garment that tends to last longer.</p>

                                    <p>Upcycling your clothing is essentially repurposing existing clothes to create new, unique outfits, accessories and more.
