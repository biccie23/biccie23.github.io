                        <br>
                            <p>The beauty industry is worth more than an astonishing $200 billion worldwide. Consider the amoung of money you spend each year on beauty products and furthermore the amount of waste involed with all this consumption. </p>

                            <p>Playing such an huge part of our consumer driven modern society, it only seems right that we should consider the environmental impact of our beauty regime. One of the biggest marketing tools used by big beauty brands are terms such as "green cosmetics" which lead consumers to make eco-friendly assumptions about the product or company.</p>
                                
                            <h5>What are green or eco-friendly beauty products?</h5>
                                
                            <p>These can be defined as cosmetic products using natural ingredients produced from renewable raw materials. Many companies use petrochemical ingredients derived from petrol, a non-renewable and economically volatile resource. Bio-based oleochemicals, on the other hand, derive from renewable plant and bacteria sources and are the crux of the green cosmetics movement.<p>
                                
                            <p>Supporting brands that use environmentally friendly ingredients isn't the only thing we can look to change. Outlined below are further sustainable swaps we can make to our everyday beauty regime to supoprt the planet. </p>
                            <br> 
                            <p class="below">Below you will find some simple swaps you can make in your beauty regime which are kinder to the envirinment.</p>

                            </div>
                            <div class="swap-box-beauty auto resp2">

                                <p>Largely composed of the plastic polypropylene, cotton buds are a big part of the wider plastic pollution problem as they are commonly flushed down the toilet in millions littering beaches and riverbanks . </p>
                                    
                                <p>The Marine Conservation Society have described cotton buds as one of the most prevalent varieties of pollution on beaches in the UK.</p>
                                    
                                <p>In response to this issue, Johnson & Johnson has vowed to stop selling plastic cotton buds in favour of paper (although still not implemented worlwide), which is far more biodegradable. 
                                    
                                <p>There are many smaller brands who manufacture eco-friendly cotton buds commonly using bamboo and organic cotton. If cotton buds are must have for you, then consider which brands and materials you are purchasing. </p>

                            <div class="swap-box-beauty auto resp2">

                                <p>According to <a href="https://www.dosomething.org/us/campaigns/rinse-recycle-repeat/faq">DoSomething.org</a> almost half of the US don't recycle their beauty and personal care products meaning their are millions of recyclable plastic bottles going to landfill each year.</p>
                                    
                                <p>Why? This is partially due to the fact that recyclables need to be clean in order to be recycled and people are not taking the time to even think to do this. It is also unlikely that most people have a recycling specific bin in their bathroom and as such this accounts for futher effort to recycle said proucts.</p>
                                    
                                <p>Alternatively, these products are available in a waste free form of a bar rather than bottle. Shampoo & conditioner bars last 3-5 times longer than the average size plastic bottle counterpart and soap has traditionally always came in a bar.</p>

                                <p>Even if many of the beauty products we purcahse do come in recyclable packaging, we can all go one step further by avoiding waste altogether and start using products that can be refilled. According to research done by <a href="https://thelcacentre.com/en/">The LAC Center</a> reported on <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/refillable-products"> refinery29.com</a> if you buy a refill instead of a completely new product, you save 70% on C02, 65% on energy and 45% on water. </p> 
                                    
                                <p>Stila offers an impressive assortment of refillable cosmetics, including powders to eye shadows. Dior is a newcomer to the trend with reusable lipstick tubes. Le Labo lets customers bring empty fragrance bottles back to the store for refills. Clean-beauty brand Kjaer Weiss sells plenty of inexpensive refill options, including foundation, bronzer, and blush packaged in paper cartons that pop right into previously-purchased compacts.</p>

                                    <h3 class ="swap-head"> SAFETY RAZORS </h3>
                            </div>
                            <div class="swap-box-beauty auto resp2">
                                <p> In the US alone over 2 billion disposable razors are thrown away each year, along with the paper and plastic packaging. Made from cheap hard plastic which is practically impossible to be resused or recycled they then find themseles in landfills where they take years to disentegrate. </p>
                            
                                <p>Safety razors are a worthy alternative, not only environmentally but they produce a higher quality shave with a lower price tag. </p>
                            
                                <p>While you may pay more upfront for a safety razor (€25-€100 with replacement blades costing €1 each) the blades last for 1-2 months with correct care of drying in between uses. The base should last you a lifetime. Compare this to the average cost of €5-10 for a pack of four disposable razors and this soon adds up to a hefty annual bill. </p>

                                <p>Microbeads are the tiny plastic bits you find in exfoliation scrubs (and even some toothpastes). Over 300,000 of them can be found in a single tube of face wash.</p>
                                                        
                                <p>These tiny plastic beads go through the water system and out into the ocean resulting in plastic particle water pollution. They are inevitably ingested by fish and other underwater life so there's a possibility we're consuming these plastic microbeads when we eat seafood.</p> 

                                <p>They are now banned in the UK and are soon to be banned in Ireland. </p>
                            
                                <p>For places where they are still in production, check your scrub's label – if you see "polyethylene" or "polypropylene" listed, it's made with plastic microbeads.</p>

This means they are sent to landfill, or worse end up in our oceans due to people flushing them down the toilet. </p>
                                    
                                <p>If you don't want to contribute a face wipe a day to our overflowing landfills then look to using a regular cream cleanser along with a cleansing mit, resuable cloth or pad specially designed for your skin.</p>
