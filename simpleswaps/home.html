                                    <p>The United Nations defines sustainable development as meeting the needs of the present <i>“without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”</i> A wave of awareness has begun, and it is centered around saving planet Earth.</p>
                                    <p>To many, this can be an overwhelming and stressful topic to broach and the pressure to contribute can be equally stressful. Major cities are passing laws that ban single-use plastics. Recycling and composting have become more popular and convenient. There is also pressure to trade in our sleek sedans for electric cars; all in an effort to save our home planet.</p>
        
                                    <p>Most of the messages are saddled with the notion that what we do now will influence future generations. Although this concept might appeal to some individuals, others cannot be concerned with the future when they are trying to pay their rent and water bills.</p>
        
                                    <p>There are many ways that each of us can contribute without major monetary commitments or lifestyle changes and here you will find a series of simple swaps we can make in our everyday lives without too much effort. </p>
