                            <br>
                            <div class="text">
                            <p>Plastic is everywhere, we can’t escape it, and it is having huge impacts on our planet. Since the 1950s, around 8.3 billion tons of plastic have been produced worldwide - that's eqivalent to the weight of more than 800,000 Eiffel Towers. Why is this much plastic such a problem?<p>
 
                                <ul> 
                                    <li><h5>Plastic Isn’t Biodegradable.</h5></li>
                                <p>When we throw something in the bin we say we have thrown it “away”. In reality, there is no “away”. This plastic is still somewhere on our planet. In a landfill, in the ocean, on the streets. It still exists. Plastic takes hundred if not thousands of years to biodegrade. And in reality, it most likely won’t ever disappear but instead becomes long-lasting (and toxic) “plastic dust”.</p>
                                
                                <li><h5>The Production of Plastic</h5></li>
                                <p>The vast majority of plastic is made of polypropylene, a material made from petroleum (oil) and gas. These two materials are non-renewable fossil fuel based. Their extraction and production create greenhouse gases which contribute to climate change. The production process itself is inefficient, for example the process of producing bottled water required 6 times as much water per bottle as there is in the actual container and 2,000 times the overall energy required to drink tap water. The total amount of energy required to drive a car for one kilometre or 0.5 miles is the equivalent energy required to produce nine plastic bags.</p>
                                
                                
                                <li><h5>Ocean Plastic</h5></li>
                                <p>We dump 8 million tonnes of plastic into the ocean each year and there is set to be more plastic that fish in the sea by 2050, if not sooner. There are 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic debris in the ocean right now. In huge “trash islands” there are 520,000 pieces of plastic per square mile.</p>
                                
                                <p>This ocean plastic is not only damaging the oceans themselves, but the creatures who live there. Over 1,000,000 seabirds are killed by plastic pollution in the oceans each year. As well as 300,000 dolphins and porpoises. Not to mention numerous seals, sharks, whales, turtles, fish and more. Often the plastic clogs these animals stomachs and leads to a slow, painful death through starvation.</p>
                                
                                <p>Plastic pollution is urgently threatening the whole underwater ecosystem. This, combined with climate change, is leading to some seriously worrying damage to the ocean. These changes put our very survival at risk. Over 50% of the oxygen we breathe is produced by the ocean, thats every second breath. Ultimately, if the oceans die, we die.</p>
                                
                                <li><h5>Can't we just recycle?</h5></li>
                                
                                <p>Recycling is of course better than landfill, but it is still a complicated business. It takes enormous amounts of energy and resources to do so. Due to this, it is typically used to  make secondary non-recyclable products. As such, recycling your plastic bottle is not closing the loop, it still has a waste footprint.</p>
                                
                                <p>The best solution is to focus on reducing the plastic in your life. Below you can see some simple swaps we can make to do so. </p>

                                    <p>In the US alone 15 billion disposable coffee cups are used a year.

As an added bonus these get discounts on drinks at most coffee chains!</p>

                                    <p>We are lucky in the UK & Ireland to have legislation whereby you have to pay a small fee for a plastic bag, meaning there is a financial incentive to carrying a a reusable tote bag with you.</p>
